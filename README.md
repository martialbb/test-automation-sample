This sample is simple approach for test the Square Payment API using python.
The endpoints to be tested are:
- Create payment
- Complete payment
- List payments
- Cancel payment
- Search payment
- Update payment

Ideally, a framework should be built to test an API for the testing to be scalable.
The tests make an http requests to those endpoints and validate the responses.

An ideal test should have the input parameterized, this currently not the case at this time.
